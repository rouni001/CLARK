		distribution of the targets identified per report.
02/20/2019	Version 1.2.6: A new script is added to extract sequences identified to a 
		specific taxon. The script "estimate_abundance.sh" allows now to output the 
		results in the mpa format (tab-delimited format from MetaPhlAn).
		Code improvements and bug fixes are included.
09/20/2018	Version 1.2.5.1: Option to process long reads/contig for the full mode and CLARK-S
		variant. A script to get statistics of the target-specific k-mers is added.
		Code improvements and bug fixes are included.
03/05/2018	Extend the database of fungi to 47 reference genomes. Bug fix.
02/13/2018	Version 1.2.5: Database extension for fungi. Plasmid, plastid and protozoa databases 
		from RefSeq (complete genomes) are included. Code improvements/bug fixes included.
11/25/2017 	Version 1.2.4: In addition to the bacteria/archaea, viruses and human, a 
		database of fungi is made available. A list of 29 reference genomes from RefSeq 
		corresponding to known hospital-acquired infections and other nosocomial diseases 
		represents the first basis of this new database. 
		Code improvements and bug fixes are included.
09/23/2017	Bug fix: Targets count limit for CLARK and CLARK-l.
08/21/2017	Added corrections to some issues with filenames length, short Fasta/Fastq files.
		Modified the previous script "makeSummaryTable" to produce two tables for 
		an extended analysis of the CLARK report files.
06/09/2017 	Added corrections to some inconsistencies/bug in estimate_abundance.sh,
		makeSummaryTable.sh and settings for Fastq/Fasta handler class in the Full mode.  
02/27/2017	Added a new script for digesting several reports files, "makeSummaryTable.sh".
		Updated copyright and email info.
07/25/2016	Update/Fix code error/warnings for Mac Os.

		Bug fix for gzipped paired-end reads. Code improvement.
04/12/2016	Updates in v1.2.3: Scripts to generate the target definition using the accession 
		number instead of the GI number have been updated. Additional scripts have been 
		added to facilitate the creation and changes of the customized databases.
		Code improvement on the targets definition and bug fixes are included.
04/07/2016	Release of v1.2.3:
		Added new features for the CLARK-S (i.e., full and express mode are available),
		Bug fixes and Code improvement are included.
03/15/2016	Update/Bug fix for the script downloading human data.
02/26/2016	Bug fix (special characters in reports creation) and code improvement (increased 
 		speed for the full/spaced mode).
02/18/2016	Bug fixes (max length of reads, multithreading error for Spaced mode). 
		Code improvement for the database creation.
02/08/2016	Bug fixes (i.e., old/new tax id from merged.dmp, size of the targets).
		Code improvement (i.e., reduction of the RAM usage when building the database).
01/29/2016	Copyright info (date updated).
12/15/2015	Add a script to clean all database files (useful to re-download a newer version 
		of the RefSeq databases).
12/11/2015	Release of v1.2.2-b:
		Code improvement on the memory usage of the Full/Spaced mode (scalability).
		Add a script to plot the distribution of CLARK's assignments per gamma score.
		Bug fix when running large files in the Spaced mode.
11/24/2015      Allow results creation (estimate_abundance.sh) for Krona.
11/17/2015	Fix bug when setting targets. Code simplification of the script creating the 
		databases of discriminative spaced k-mers.
09/30/2015	Add source code modification and bux fixes in v1.2.1-beta (i.e., estimate_abundance,
		sampling factor, and memory mapping settings).
06/15/2015      Release of v1.2.1-beta (more RAM-efficient), including bug fixes.
06/03/2015	Release of v1.1.3:
		Updated "full" mode with a function to (or not to) print out extended results.
                Updated the script "estimate_abundance.sh" (e.g., added a lineage column).

04/23/2015	Updated data structure for storing results of full mode.
04/22/2015	Release v1.1.2:
		Added scripts to compute abundance estimation w/o filtering on confidence 
		score and gamma score, and to evaluate/plot density of assignments per
		confidence score.
		Other features (e.g., gzipped files in input), bugs fixes and code improvements
 		are included.
04/15/2015	Release v1.1.1:
		Updated data structure (from std::vector to customized vector),
